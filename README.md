## Magnet Mobile Server SDK for Android

The Magnet Mobile Server SDK for Android is licensed under the terms of the [Magnet Software License Agreement](http://www.magnet.com/resources/tos.html). See [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for full details.


This directory contains the Magnet Mobile Server SDK for Android which includes tools and the library to build your Android app for a Mobile App Server project.

Refer to  developer.android.com for IDE requirements and details about including an Android library project in your app. Below is a quick-start summary for using Eclipse and Apache Ant.

### Supported Android Platforms:
Android API level 15 and up.

## REQUIRED: Install the Magnet library

From directory of your Android application project, install the library to your project using relative path to the SDK directory. For example, assuming the SDK directory is one level above the application project directory named "magnet-sdk-android":

    $ sh ../magnet-sdk-android/magnet-tools/install-libs.sh ../magnet-sdk-android/libproject/2.2.0 ./libs

General Usage:

    install-libs.sh <magnet-libproject-dir> <app-library-dir>
    <magnet-libproject-dir> : path to Magnet Mobile Server library project
    <app-library-dir>       : path to application specific dependent libraries, typically "libs"

For Windows:

    $ ..\magnet-sdk-android\magnet-tools\install-libs.bat ..\magnet-sdk-android\libproject\2.2.0 .\libs

Enable manifest merging by adding this line to project.properties:

    manifestmerger.enabled=true

## Optional: Google Play Services Client library

Certain features of the Mobile Server library are dependent on the Google Play Services client library such as geo constraints and offline requests. Follow instructions on [Google's Google Play Services website] (http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html) on how to add this library to your Android project. Below is a short summary of the instructions for ANT.


### Google Play Services using ANT

To add the Google Play Client Services library using ANT, follow these steps:

1. Use the Android SDK Manager to install Google Play Services.
2. Copy the directory located at extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/google-play-services_lib to another directory.
3. Build the copied Google play services library project with ant:

        $ cd google-play-services_lib
        $ android update project -p .
        $ ant debug

4. Add Google Play Service library project as a dependent library to your project. From directory of your project:

        $ android update project --path . --library <relative-path>/google-play-services_lib --target <target-id>


### Google Play Services - Required App Manifest changes

Make sure to add the following to the application's AndroidManifest.xml, as child of \<application\> element:

    <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.gms.version"
           android:value="@integer/google_play_services_version" />

### Build Android Apps with Magnet library using ANT

Add the Magnet library as a dependent library to the ANT xml file project.properties. Use a relative path. For example, run this from your Android project directory:

    $ android update project --path . --library ../magnet-sdk-android/libproject/2.2.0 --target <target-id>

For Windows:

    $ android.bat update project --path . --library ..\magnet-sdk-android\libproject\2.2.0 --target <target-id>

Note: "--target" option is required for "android" command for new projects. For more details, refer to Android Developer Guide, [Managing Project from Command Line] (http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/projects-cmdline.html).


Build your app with ANT:

    $ ant clean debug


### Build Android Apps with Magnet library using Eclipse

Create the Magnet library as an "Android Library" project and include it in your Android app as a dependency:

1. File->New Project->Android->Android Project from Existing Code
2. Browse to the unzipped Magnet library project directory and select "libproject/2.2.0" as the "Root Directory".
A new Android project will be created with the name "OAuthFlowActivity."
4. Select the newly created library project and right click Properties, under "Android", "is library" must be checked.
5. From your main Android application project, add the library project under Project Properties->"Android", select the "OAuthFlowActivity" library project and add it.
6. Build your main Android application project using Eclipse.


### Integrating Magnet generated API libraries into Android projects

IMPORTANT: It's highly recommended that you make a backup copy of the original "./libs" directory before introducing a new api library jar to "libs" directory.

This step is REQUIRED before you build your Android app.

To use custom controller APIs, integrate the library into your application build using the "install-libs" script. The API library is typically generated from the Magnet Mobile App Builder tool provided by your server team.

First, copy the custom controller api jar files to the directory where all dependent libraries are stored, typically "libs". Then, regenerate the Mobile App Server Runtime service mapping library using the script "install-libs.sh" as described above.

    $ sh ../magnet-sdk-android/magnet-tools/install-libs.sh ../magnet-sdk-android/libproject/2.2.0 ./libs

For Windows:

    $ ..\magnet-sdk-android\magnet-tools\install-libs.bat ..\magnet-sdk-android\libproject\2.2.0 .\libs

##### IMPORTANT: If you use Eclipse, after running "install-libs", you must do "Refresh" on the "libs" directory of your Android project before building the app to ensure getting the latest contents.
